I am currently in the last year of my BSc psychology degree at UCL. I have recently concluded my dissertation project 
looking at creating a translational measure of avoidance, adapted from animal approach-avoidance paradigms, with the aim 
of contributing to research investigating avoidance symptomatology in anxiety disorders. I previously experienced being 
an honorary research assistant in a qualitative project utilising the ZMET technique to investigate the moral reasoning 
patterns of extinction rebellion activists and the public. At present, I am working as an honorary research assistant in 
a project measuring bipolar moods and decision-making longitudinally using smartphone-based assessment led my Liam Mason. 
My responsibilities are to recruit healthy control and bi-polar participants as well as shadow members of the clinical 
team in the diagnostic interview and IQ assessment of participants.
