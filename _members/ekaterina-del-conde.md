I am currently in the final phase of my Master's program in Clinical Mental Health Sciences at University College London (UCL). Recently, I completed my thesis project, which focused on analyzing the impact of emotions on memory in individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Additionally, I conducted research with the objective of identifying the relationship between physical activity and various variables related to mental health, such as stress, anxiety, self-concept, and self-esteem, among young adults in Mexico.
In my current role, I serve as an honorary research assistant on a project led by Liam Mason. This project centers on the longitudinal assessment of bipolar mood states and decision-making using smart devices. My responsibilities include recruiting both individuals with bipolar disorder and healthy participants, training new team members and acquainting them with the project, as well as creating and maintaining the laboratory website.
