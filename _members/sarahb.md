I am a PhD student on the Wellcome Trust Mental Health Science programme at UCL and I completed a first year rotation project
supervised by Dr. Liam Mason. During this rotation, I worked on a project on heart rate variability in individuals with PTSD 
and schizophrenia. I am particularly interested in the impact of early-life adversity and trauma, the mechanisms of anxiety 
disorders, and the implementation of evidence-based interventions. Before the programme, I completed a BSc in Psychology at 
McGill and a MRes in Developmental Neuroscience and Psychopathology at UCL. During my masters, I worked on a project on the 
neural correlates of cognitive reappraisal in anxiety disorders at Yale University and I contributed to the creation and 
teaching of a massive open online course on the impact of childhood maltreatment from the neuroscience perspective.
