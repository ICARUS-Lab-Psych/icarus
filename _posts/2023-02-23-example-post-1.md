To investigate the recursive cycles by which mood biases reward perception, we combine 
Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian inference frameworks with smartphone-based cognitive 
tasks and monitoring. Utilises a smartphone app for the cognitive science of happiness 
(Happiness Project: link), led by Robb Rutledge (Yale University) which has over 15,000 users 
and has already been adopted by many clinical studies worldwide.
