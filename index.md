Our research views psychopathology and clinical interventions through a neuro-computational lens. We examine the mechanisms 
of dysregulated mood and goal-directed behavior, as well as the mechanisms by which interventions exert their effects.

Our work focuses on three core themes: reward processes in mood disorders, neurobiological mechanisms of action of psychological 
therapies and, to a lesser extent, the prediction of health behaviours during global crises. In all areas, our major goal is to 
leverage basic findings towards clinical and public health interventions.

Our expertise cuts across affective neuroscience, reward-based decision-making, computational psychiatry, and psychological therapy.

We draw heavily on neuroimaging and ambulatory and smartphone-based assessment as powerful combined tools.
