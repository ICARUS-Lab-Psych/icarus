I am an MRC funded PhD student at King's College London supervised by Emmanuelle Peters and Liam Mason ((+Steve?)). My work
investigates the neural mechanisms of trauma memory recall in people with dual-diagnosed PTSD-psychosis. Using task-based and 
resting state functional MRI alongside experience sampling method, my aim is to provide a mechanistic understanding of trauma
memory recall and related cognitions. I am particularly interested in open research methods and data-driven analysis processes. 
I received a BSc in Psychology from the University of Bath and Research MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience from Leiden University. 
Prior to joining the MRC Doctoral Training Partnership at King’s, I worked at the Developmental Risk and Resilience Unit at 
University College London.
