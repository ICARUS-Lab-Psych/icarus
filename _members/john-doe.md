I am completing my PhD at the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry supervised by Liam Mason and Quentin Huys. 
I am investigating the mechanisms underlying aberrant information processing in mood disorders, with the ultimate goal of 
developing better interventions. I use behavioural experiments, deployed online and via smartphone app (which I co-developed),
combined with computational modelling to characterise the effect mood has on learning, decision-making, and memory. I completed
my BSc in Psychology from the University of Aberdeen and an MSc in Mental Health Studies from King’s College London. Before 
joining the lab, I worked as a researcher in the Psychosis Studies group at King’s College London.
