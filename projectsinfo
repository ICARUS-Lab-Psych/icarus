I am a PhD student at the UCL-Wellcome Mental Health Science Programme. During my rotation supervised by Liam Mason,
I looked into how SSRIs impact reward perception during learning on the ‘Happiness' app data.
Currently, my main PhD project, supervised by Oliver Robinson, is on disentangling the cognitive mechanisms of 
different anxiety disorders. I’m particularly interested in the differences and similarities in how state anxiety 
induced by threat of shock, panic induced by 7.5% CO2 inhalation, and acute stress induced by the Social Stress Test,
affects cognitive function.
