I am completing my Doctorate in Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) at UCL. As part of my training I am completing a dissertation 
project in which I am studying how daily life events and our expectations about them impact our mood and how our mood, in turn, 
impacts our expectations.Â  The data I use is collected via ecological momentary assessment (EMA), meaning that participants respond 
to daily notifications on a smartphone app to let us know their mood and daily activities. Before starting my DClinPsy I completed 
an undergraduate degree in Psychology at University of Edinburgh, an MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL, and a PGCert in Data 
Analytics at University of Glasgow. I also worked as a Research Assistant for the Neurodegeneration in Aging Down Syndrome (NiAD) 
study at University of Cambridge.
