I am a PhD Student on the BBSRC funded LIDo DTP. My research interest broadly lies in understanding how human cognition can be biased
and as a result distort what we perceive, learn and remember. My hope is to understand how this manifests in the general population and
those with elevated anxiety or depression. To investigate this I will use behavioural tasks in conjunction with neuroimaging to probe 
the underlying neural mechanisms.
