I am a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) trainee undertaking my dissertation with Liam Mason. My project aims
to utilise smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment data to evaluate whether mood bias predicts mood variability 
in individuals with bipolar disorder. Prior to this, I completed a BSc in Psychology with Education at UCL and an MSc in 
Psychological Research at the University of Oxford. I previously worked as a research assistant at the Oxford Centre for 
Emotions and Affective Neuroscienceâ€”investigating the relationship between anxiety and eating disorder tendencies in 
adolescents, and the impact of COVID-19 on young people and their carers. I have also worked as a research assistant at 
the Decision and Action Lab at the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, where I assisted on a study using 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to identify the neural substrates of social decision making.
