As part of the UCL–Wellcome PhD in Mental Health Science, I am currently completing a rotation in the Research Department of
Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, supervised by Liam Mason. My project uses data collected via a mobile app to model
the dynamics of mood in relation to salient events in participants’ daily lives, and to investigate how these are affected by 
SSRIs. We aim to further develop existing computational models of affect using these data collected in an ecological setting.
I read Natural Sciences at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in 2022. Before joining UCL, I also worked as a 
research assistant in the Digital Mental Health Group at the MRC Cognition & Brain Sciences Unit, investigating the mental health 
associations of digital technology access among adolescents.
