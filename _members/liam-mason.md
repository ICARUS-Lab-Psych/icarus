I joined the department as a Lecturer in Clinical Psychology in 2018 and was subsequently awarded an MRC Clinician Scientist Fellowship, based at the Max Planck Centre for Computational Psychiatry, part of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Neuroimaging.

I am a supervisor on several PhD programmes, including the MRC DTP PhD pathway. I have supervised MSc/MRes students from the Cognitive Neuroscience, Cognitive and Decision Sciences, Social Cognition, and Advanced Neuroimaging programmes. I find supervision to be one of the most rewarding aspects of being a researcher and academic, and my style is to always strive to match the level of work put in by students I supervise. 
I also welcome applications from postgraduate students for internships and placements.
