Trauma experience and psychosis often co-occur. Symptoms of both conditions overlap, including trauma memory intrusions,
negative appraisals of self/others, and hypervigilance to threat. With task-based functional MRI, physiological measures
during scans and EMA, we are investigating the neural basis and daily symptom patterns associated with dual-diagnosed 
PTSD-psychosis.
