I am a final year trainee clinical psychologist at UCL. I did my undergraduate at Robinson College, Cambridge followed by a 
masters in Child and Adolescent Mental Health at UCL. After that, I completed my PhD at Kingâ€™s College London looking at affective
and neurocognitive mechanisms associated with restricted, repetitive behaviours in autism. During my PhD, I developed an interest 
in computational modeling and used models to examine probabilistic reversal learning in relation to insistence on sameness behaviours
across development. I am particularly interested in the use of these methods within clinical psychology research in order to better 
understand the nuances of learning and decision-making processes in relation to mental health symptomatology and neurodiversity. 
Currently, my project seeks to understand the mechanisms of change underpinning behavioural activation for depression.
