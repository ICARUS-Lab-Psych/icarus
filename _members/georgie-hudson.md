I am completing my PhD on the UCL Wellcome 4-year PhD in Mental Health Science programme and am doing a rotation project, supervised 
by Liam Mason. I have particular interests in young people's mental health, the impact of trauma on psychosis, and patient and public
involvement in research. I completed my BSc in Psychology at the University of Leeds. While completing my degree I worked as Research 
Assistant at King's College London, investigating resilience to mental health problems in children and adolescents. After graduating, 
I worked as a Research Assistant at the Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust & King’s
College London for two years. In this role I set up the Adolescent Mental Health Advisory group, which I led along with the Young 
Person’s Mental Health Advisory Group, empowering young people to contribute to research and express their vital and under-represented views.
