To investigate the recursive cycles by which mood biases reward perception, we combine 
Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian inference frameworks with smartphone-based cognitive 
tasks and monitoring. Utilises a smartphone app for the cognitive science of happiness 
(Happiness Project: https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/news-item/new-app-designed-to-help-scientists-figure-out-what-determines-happiness-though-fun-games/), led by Robb Rutledge (Yale University) which has over 15,000 users 
and has already been adopted by many clinical studies worldwide.
